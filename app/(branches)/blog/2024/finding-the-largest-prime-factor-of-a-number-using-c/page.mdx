# Finding the Largest Prime Factor of a Number Using C

One of the fascinating problems in mathematics and programming is finding the largest prime factor of a number.

In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how I solved the problem of finding the largest prime factor of the number
*600851475143* using the C programming language. This exercise not only strengthens understanding of prime numbers but
also provides a great opportunity to implement loops, conditionals, and functions in C.

## Understanding the Problem

A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number. For example: The prime factors of *28* are *2* and *7* because
both are prime numbers and divide *28* without leaving a remainder.

Given a large number, such as *600851475143*, find the largest prime factor.

## The Solution in C

To solve this, I wrote a program in C. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

Firstly, we need a utility function called ```isPrime``` to check if a number is prime. A prime number is only divisible by 1
and itself. This idea can be translated into a function that loops through a given number starting from 2 and ending at
the last number before the given number.

Here’s the function:

```c
bool isPrime(const int input) {
    for (int i = 2; i < input; i++) {
        if (input % i == 0) return false;
    }

    return input > 1;
}
```

The next step is to create a function called ```largestPrimeNumber``` iterate through all potential divisors starting
from 2. If a divisor divides the number perfectly, we divide the number by that divisor and check if it’s a prime number
by calling the ```isPrime``` function.

At each iteration, if the divisor is prime and larger than the previous largest prime factor, we update our result.
Here’s the full implementation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Utility function to find if a number is prime
bool isPrime(const int input) {
    for (int i = 2; i < input; i++) {
        if (input % i == 0) return false;
    }
    return input > 1;
}

// Function to find the largest prime factor
int largestPrimeFactor(long num) {
    int largestPrimeFactor = 0;

    for (int divisor = 2; divisor <= num; divisor++) {
        if (num % divisor == 0) {
            num = num / divisor;

            // Update largestPrimeFactor
            if (isPrime(divisor) && largestPrimeFactor < divisor)
                largestPrimeFactor = divisor;
        }
    }
    return largestPrimeFactor;
}

int main() {
    const long num = 600851475143;

    largestPrimeFactor(num)
        ? printf("The largest prime factor of %ld is %d\n", num, largestPrimeFactor(num))
        : printf("%ld has no prime factor\n", num);

    return 0;
}
```

When you run the program, it should print:

```The largest prime factor of 600851475143 is 6857```

## Optimizations and Improvements
The solution works but can be optimized:
1. *Prime Checking*: Instead of checking divisors from *2* to *input - 1*, only check up to the square root of the number. I
learnt this smart idea from [Dr. Emeka Ogbuju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emekaogbuju/).
2. *Divisor Iteration*: After dividing by a prime factor, we can skip other even numbers by incrementing by 2 for odd divisors.

The codebase is also on [github](https://github.com/omeiza/largest-prime-factor-in-c).

If you’re learning C, I encourage you to tweak this program! Try implementing the optimizations or finding the largest
prime factor of another number. Happy coding!
