# I am still teaching coding - AI will not replace us

So, something cool happened recently—my department’s class rep at [Miva Open University](https://miva.university/) hit me up, asking if I’d be interested in teaching my classmates how to code.
I didn't even have to think twice before saying yes! Teaching has always been something I enjoy, and well, this isn’t my first time doing it.

Now, let’s be real—schools don’t always do the best job of teaching students the actual skills they need to thrive in the real world. I mean, ask any Computer Science student,
and they’ll probably tell you they’ve spent more time on theory than actually writing code. That’s why I’m excited about this opportunity—to make sure my classmates don’t just
learn about coding but actually code!

But here’s the thing: I don’t want this to feel like some boring, rigid class where I’m just throwing information at people. Nope! This is going to be a fun, collaborative
experience where we all learn, build, and grow together.

## AI is Coming for Coders… Or Is It?

Now, before we dive into what we’ll be learning, let’s address the elephant in the room — AI. There’s been a lot of chatter about AI replacing coders, and I get why people are worried.
With tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT helping developers write code faster, some might wonder if learning to code is still worth it.

But here’s the truth: AI isn’t replacing coders; it’s changing the way we code. Just like calculators didn't replace mathematicians, AI won’t replace programmers—it will just make us
more efficient. The real value lies in knowing how to think like a coder, how to solve problems, and how to work alongside AI instead of fearing it.

That’s exactly why this class is important! We’re not just learning how to type out code—we’re learning how to think like problem-solvers. AI can generate code, but it still needs humans
who understand what that code does, how to debug it, and how to build something meaningful with it.

## What Will We Be Learning?

Since I’m at Miva to strengthen my theoretical knowledge in Computer Science (even though I’ve been working as a Software Developer for years), I know firsthand how important it is to connect
theory with practical coding. That’s why I’ll be teaching Python and JavaScript.

Why these two? Simple! Most of my classmates are interested in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence—and guess what? JavaScript is the language of the web, while Python is a powerhouse
for AI and machine learning. It’s a win-win!

## How’s the Learning Going to Work?

For [Python](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NFhZROaIMZ4PbpRfMSMvpPdNP5XgCBhDrMrFT33Xb4s/edit?usp=sharing), we’ll start with the basics, then gradually move into intermediate-level concepts. But we won’t just learn syntax—we’ll work on real projects that help solidify what we’re learning.
I’ve put together a 14-week curriculum that takes us step by step from beginner to advanced.

For [JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-Zbt9witUIgiO2s9tYtRKjhJQj3YXQ3HqhPYFFisSs/edit?usp=sharing), we’ll follow a similar approach, but with more HTML & CSS in the early stages, since understanding the structure of web pages is key for web development—especially for beginners.

## The Goal?

The biggest hurdle for beginners isn’t the code itself—it’s confidence. A lot of people feel like they’re “not smart enough” to code, and that’s just not true. My goal is to help my classmates
get comfortable coding, overcome self-doubt, and build projects they’re proud of.

And let’s be honest, this isn’t just a learning experience for them—it’s one for me too! I get to refine my own skills, improve my teaching methods, and learn from their perspectives.

## Learning Should Be Fun!

At the end of the day, learning is way more fun when it’s purposeful and connected to what you’re genuinely interested in. Of course, there will be times when we have to learn things that don’t
immediately excite us, but that’s where resilience and self-motivation come in.

One thing’s for sure—whether AI is writing code or not, the world will always need creative problem solvers who can think critically and innovate. That’s what coding is really about.

So yeah, I’m super excited about this! Let’s get coding and make this an awesome experience. 🚀
