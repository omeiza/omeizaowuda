# The New Luddites: Smashing Looms, Dodging Algorithms

Sometimes, being called a [Luddite](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/why-did-the-luddites-protest/) feels like an insult. It paints you as the person who won't download the latest app, who still clings to paper planners, or who insists 
books smell better than Kindles (which is true). But the original Luddites weren't anti-tech cavemen - they were skilled craftspeople who feared being replaced by machines.

Fast-forward 200 years, and the loom has been upgraded to AI. Everywhere you look, algorithms are writing essays, coding apps, designing logos, and maybe even plotting 
your next career crisis. And just like the Luddites, we're asking uneasy questions: Will my skills matter in five years? Is this “progress,” or just disruption dressed 
up in a shiny new interface?

The irony is that the Luddites didn't lose because they were wrong. They lost because the world decided efficiency mattered more than craftsmanship. Which makes me wonder - 
are we heading down the same path, only this time the machines can rhyme while they do it?

## The $30,000 Baby Name Problem
On Tuesday, I got a call from someone who wanted help building an AI model that generates names. The timing was suspiciously perfect - she'd just read about a [woman 
charging $30,000](https://nypost.com/2025/09/29/lifestyle/baby-name-consultant-taylor-humphrey-charges-30k-to-help-new-parents-choose/) to help parents pick baby names. Thirty grand. For syllables.

But here's where the Luddites come back in. They smashed looms because machines threatened their livelihood. Meanwhile, we're out here building machines to compete with 
someone whose entire job is basically “scroll the dictionary and invoice aggressively.”

I believe growth happens when we connect the dots between different worlds. The problems we face in software often mirror the challenges we face in life. AI adds another 
layer, pushing us to rethink how we work, create, and live.

Now, I didn't say no. Honestly, why would I? If people are willing to pay a Tesla's worth of cash for names like Jessica or Julius, then maybe an AI that spits out 
“unique” baby names isn't the worst idea. At least it'd be cheaper.

The Luddites used hammers to spread their message. I just need you to use the share button.

If you smiled, rolled your eyes, or briefly considered naming your child Promptheus, do me a favor: share this newsletter page with a friend or colleague. They deserve 
the chaos too.

Until then, I'll keep dodging algorithms… and waiting for the day someone wires me $30,000 to name their baby Null.
