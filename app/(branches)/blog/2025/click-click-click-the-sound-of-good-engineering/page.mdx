# Click Click Click: The Sound of Good Engineering

There's a new sound in my workspace this week. A soft, confident click that punctuates each thought. It's coming from my new Logitech MX Mechanical Mini, which now sits proudly on my desk 
like it's running the show.

It's small, but don't let that fool you. Every key has purpose. The tactile switches click with the kind of conviction my old laptop keyboard could only dream of.

And with the palm rest I added, my hands have never felt more at peace - like they've joined a yoga retreat for wrists.

I didn't expect a keyboard to make me this happy, but here we are. The sound, the feel, the rhythm - it's like typing with confidence again. Each keystroke feels like a small declaration: 
I mean this.

Earlier this week, I had my first call with our new Head of Engineering. It wasn't a big strategic summit 😂. More like, “Hi, nice to meet you, let's fix some processes before they fix us.”

We talked about how to make our process smoother and efficient. It was simple, calm, and oddly satisfying.

And somewhere between his thoughtful tone and my clicking keyboard, I realized: good engineering sounds a certain way.

It's not noise - it's rhythm.

It's the steady hum of a healthy feedback loop.

It's a pull request that makes you nod instead of sigh.

It's conversations that click - where honesty and respect share the same channel.

Not so long ago, I met up with a friend - the kind who compliments you by challenging you.

We talked about life and how much I miss the fast chaos of building back in Nigeria. Then he said something that stuck:

“You've done so much in Nigerian tech already. Why don't you share more of it?”

I mumbled something about preferring to build quietly.

He laughed.

“That's fine, just don't be quiet forever.”

He's right. Sharing is another kind of feedback loop - it keeps ideas moving, connecting, evolving. Pressing publish is just another way of pressing enter.

Lately, I've been watching a YouTube series about two guys building an AI company called Eden - a search engine for your memory.

It's the kind of storytelling that reminds you why building things still matters. No hype, no noise - just two founders trying, failing, learning, and telling their story with honesty.

It's oddly pure. Encouraging, even. The kind of rhythm you don't get from pitch decks or launch days - just people building with care.

And maybe that's what ties it all together for me this week - a new keyboard, a new teammate, a good friend, and two guys on YouTube.

Good engineering isn't silent. It has texture.

It clicks, it loops, it listens.

And when you find your rhythm, whether in code, leadership, or storytelling - it sounds something like this:

Click, Click, Click​
​the sound of good engineering.
