# Balancing Work, Study, and Life: My First Year at Miva Open University

Most journeys start with a mix of clear intentions, lingering doubts, and a dash of perspective shaped by past experiences. For me, the last part rings especially true.

Let me give you some context: I’ve always been skeptical about traditional education. My first attempt at it was studying Quantity Surveying at
[Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU)](https://oauife.edu.ng/), but it was a struggle to enjoy the learning process as much as I’d hoped.

Fast forward a few years, and I found myself thriving in the tech industry. I spent nine years as a Software Developer, building platforms you might
recognize—[TechCabal](https://techcabal.com/), [Notjustok](https://notjustok.com/), and [Zikoko](https://www.zikoko.com/), to name a few. I even led development teams
as an Engineering Manager.

But by the end of 2022, I hit a wall. After seven years of non-stop work without a meaningful break (which, by the way, I do not recommend), I lost all motivation.
Burnout hit hard, and I knew I needed to step back. So, I took a three-month break, even though it might’ve cost me my job. I wasn’t sure how I’d feel afterward, but I
needed to reset. It was one of the lowest points in my life.

During that break, I had a lot of time to reflect—on my career, work-life balance, and most importantly, what I wanted for the next 5–10 years. I realized that my
happiest moments had been back at OAU when I first discovered software development. The curiosity, the problem-solving—it energized me.

That spark of curiosity led me to Machine Learning. The world of AI felt like the perfect blend of intellectual challenge and opportunity for groundbreaking work. But this
wasn’t something I could self-learn like I did with web development. I needed a solid foundation in Mathematics and Algorithms, and that meant going back to school.

This time, I wanted to do it right. After comparing the syllabi of several open universities, I chose Miva Open University. Miva checked all the boxes: an excellent
[computer science program](https://miva.university/bsc-in-computer-science/), affordability, and core values like empathy and innovation.

## The Miva Experience
[Miva](https://miva.university/) is a Nigerian Open University, and my experience so far has been refreshingly positive. The tutors are smart, humble, and genuinely
invested in their students’ learning—something I wasn’t used to seeing in Nigerian universities.

In my first semester, I tackled [Linear Algebra 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra), taught by an award-winning mathematician. In my second semester,
I found joy in Calculus and even [got my hands dirty with C programming](https://www.omeizaowuda.com/blog/2024/finding-the-largest-prime-factor-of-a-number-using-c). Surprisingly, I also loved the English
course, thanks to an amazing and calm instructor.

Right now, I’m taking some of the courses I’ve been most excited about, and the journey is just getting started.

## On Self-Discipline
Studying at Miva while working full-time as a Software Developer—and running my software consulting company, Visolab—has taught me more on the importance of self-discipline
and time management.

One book that really helped me is [*The 5 AM Club*](https://www.amazon.com/AM-Club-Morning-Elevate-Life/dp/1443456624) by Robin Sharma. It’s helped me structure my day
to get more done without burning out. These days, I juggle work, learning, and personal growth more efficiently than I thought possible.

## Conclusion
This is just the beginning of my journey to becoming a [Machine Learning Engineer](https://brainstation.io/career-guides/what-is-a-machine-learning-engineer). I plan to keep documenting my experiences and sharing what I learn along the way. In fact,
I’ll be starting a YouTube channel soon to make this journey even more fun and accessible.

Oh, and just so you know, everything I’ve shared about Miva is based on my personal experience—I wasn’t paid to write this.

So, if you’re considering taking a leap into open education or pursuing a new career path, I hope my story inspires you. Let’s keep learning and growing together!
